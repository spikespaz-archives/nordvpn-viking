# Viking for NordVPN

This project aims to provide a fully usable and feature-complete graphical interface for NordVPN on Linux.

While it attempts to closely model the look of the official applications for Windows and macOS, it is unique, being built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [GTK](https://gtk-rs.org/).
